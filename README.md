**Titanic Data Analysis Project**

**Overview**

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the survival rates of passengers based on various factors. The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status. The analysis utilizes Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to derive insights and visualize data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

- `survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `pclass`: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `age`: Age of the passenger
- `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- `fare`: Ticket fare
- `embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- Additional features relevant for the analysis



**Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- **Development Environment:** PyCharm

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization techniques
- Statistical analysis using Python libraries

**How To Install**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jassithecoder/Titanic-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Titanic-data-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

**Usage**

Run the analysis script:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the analysis and generate visualizations of the results.
