**Titanic Data Analysis Project**

**Overview**

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the survival rates of passengers based on various factors. The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status. The analysis utilizes Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to derive insights and visualize data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle. It contains the following features:

- `survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `pclass`: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `sex`: Gender of the passenger
- `age`: Age of the passenger
- `sibsp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- `parch`: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- `fare`: Ticket fare
- `embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- Additional features relevant for the analysis



**Technologies Used**

   git clone https://github.com/Jassithecoder/Titanic-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Titanic-data-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```

**Usage**

Run the analysis script:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the analysis and generate visualizations of the results.

**Output**

The analysis includes various outputs, such as:

- Descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Correlation heatmaps
- Survival rates by gender and passenger class
